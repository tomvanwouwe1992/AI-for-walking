Using evolutionary algorithms to learn a musculoskeletal model balance and walk

The goal of this project is to use evolutionary algorithms for learning musculoskeletal models to walk and control their balance.
The EAs develop a neural network controller through generational evolution ending optimizing certain self chosen optimization criteria.
